    charset-8 character encoding 
    This attribute declares the page's character encoding. It must contain a standard IANA MIME name for character encodings. Although the standard doesn't request a specific encoding, it suggests:

Authors are encouraged to use UTF-8.
Authors should not use ASCII-incompatible encodings to avoid security risk: browsers not supporting them may interpret harmful content as HTML. This happens with the JIS_C6226-1983, JIS_X0212-1990, HZ-GB-2312, JOHAB, the ISO-2022 family and the EBCDIC family.
Note: ASCII-incompatible encodings are those that don't map the 8-bit code points 0x20 to 0x7E to the 0x0020 to 0x007E Unicode code points)

Authors must not use CESU-8, UTF-7, BOCU-1 and/or SCSU as cross-site scripting attacks with these encodings have been demonstrated.<br>
